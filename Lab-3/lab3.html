	<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>JHyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a type of markup language.[1] It is used to make webpages.
       Webpages can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. HTML tells web browsers
       what webpages should look like. HTML also adds meta information to webpages. Meta information is information
       about about a webpage e.g., the name of the person who created the page. Web browsers usually do not show meta information.
       HTML is often used with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. CSS is used to change the way HTML looks. JavaScript tells
       websites how to behave. It can also change HTML and CSS.
       HTML is made by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). There are many versions of HTML. As of September 2018, the current standard of 
       HTML is called HTML 5 and is specifically at version 5.2.

	 <h2>History</h2>
	 <p>The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML.
        The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in December 1999.
        Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. XML is a standard markup language that is used to create other markup languages.
        Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including GML (Geography Markup Language), MathML, MusicML, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication).
        Since each of these languages was written in a common language (XML), their content can easily be shared across applications. This makes XML
        potentially very powerful, and it's no surprise that the W3C would create an XML version of HTML (again, called XHTML). XHTML became an official
        standard in 2000, and was updated in 2002. XHTML is very similar to HTML, but has stricter rules. Strict rules are necessary for all XML languages,
        because without it, interoperability between applications would be impossible. You'll learn more about the differences between HTML and XHTML in Unit 2.</p>
