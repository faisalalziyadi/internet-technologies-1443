    <h1>Javascript</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a high-level programming language that follows
	   the ECMAScript standard. It was originally designed as a scripting
	   language for websites but became widely adopted as a general-purpose programming language,
	   and is currently the most popular programming language in use.[1] JavaScript is usually found
	   running in a web browser as interactive or automated content, ranging from popup messages and live
	   clocks to large web applications. JavaScript is also commonly used in server-side programming through
	   platforms like Node.js,[2] or "embedded" in non-JavaScript applications where the base programming language
	   lacks the high-level functionality that JavaScript offers.
       Despite the similarities in name and syntax, JavaScript is not related to the programming
       language Java. Though the names of both languages are trademarks of Oracle Corporation, the two languages follow different design
       principles, and are actively developed by unrelated organizations.</p>

	 <h2>History</h2>
	 <p>While JavaScript, as first developed by Netscape (and later Mozilla), has long had a presence on the Web for many websites,
        it gained a particular pitch with the rise of the Web 2.0 era of computing, in which JavaScript became increasingly
        used for the development of user interfaces for applications, both web-based and desktop-based.
        JavaScript was also combined with CSS to create dynamic web pages, which have also become popular
        as a more efficient and accessible alternative to Flash-based websites.</p>
